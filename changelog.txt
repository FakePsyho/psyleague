[0.3.0]
* games can now store additional custom data (per test or per player):
    - you can use test data to recalculate ratings on a subset of games (via show --filters)
    - you can display player data on the leaderboard (check out the config file for more information)
    - play_game script now uses a new JSON format and allows for returning multiple games; old format has been removed
    - .games file: format changed to JSON
    - see readme.md for CodinGame-specific play_game script example that uses the new standard and allows for easy data extraction
* run: -w/--workers N overrides the number of workers set in the config file
* bot show: -s/--resample N displays the ranking using bootstrapped (resampling with replacement) with N games
* bot remove: removes a bot along with all games and recalculates the entire ranking (execution might take a while)
* bot update: -n/--new_name renames bot (this is only partially supported as this doesn't change the bot executable file; warning: can be slow as it updates the whole .games file)
* bot stop/remove: you can stop/remove multiple bots by specifying a comma-separated list of names
* some bugfixes and better error checking in a few places
